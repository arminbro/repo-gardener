# Repo Gardener

<!-- **Repo Gardener** is a GitHub Action designed to help maintain clean and organized repositories by monitoring inactive branches. This tool scans for branches that have been inactive for a specified duration (based on the last commit date) and automatically opens a pull request for each branch. The branch creator is assigned as the reviewer, allowing them to either merge their work or close the PR and delete the branch, ensuring your repository remains streamlined and clutter-free.

## Features
- Scans branches for inactivity based on the number of days since the last commit.
- Ignores protected branches and branches that already have an open pull request.
- Creates a pull request for each inactive branch targeting the base branch.
- Assigns the branch creator as the reviewer for the PR.
- Provides a customizable inactivity threshold and base branch.

## Usage
To use **Repo Gardener**, add it to your workflow file:

```yaml
name: "Run Repo Gardener"
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # Runs weekly

          base_branch: main
